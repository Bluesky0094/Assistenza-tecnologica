# About me

My name is **Stefano**. I help individuals and small businesses solve tech and digital problems in a simple, clear, and secure way.

Over the years I've worked hands-on with real situations: when a device stops working, when an account gets locked, when a setup must be rebuilt from scratch, or when someone needs help bringing order to emails, passwords, backups, apps, Wi-Fi, and documents. My approach is practical: I understand the issue quickly, choose the cleanest solution, and explain it without unnecessary jargon.

For me, trust is not a slogan. It means attention to detail, respect for privacy, sensible choices, and leaving everything more stable and understandable than before. If something isn't worth doing, I'll say so. If a longer process is safer and more reliable, I'll recommend it.

## What I do

I mainly help with:

- **PC, smartphone, and tablet support** (setup, software issues, performance, updates, backups)
- **Home internet & networking** (Wi-Fi, routers, printers, unstable connections)
- **Account security** (access recovery, 2FA, password management, scam prevention)
- **Documents & multimedia** (layouts, PDFs, graphics, general digital support)
- **Video editing** (clean edits, social-ready exports, workflow and formats)
- **Basic websites** (simple, fast, clear pages to present a business)

## How I work

- **Fast, transparent diagnosis**: understand first, act second.
- **Clean solutions**: no quick hacks that create problems later.
- **Clear explanations**: you get guidance to avoid the same issue again.
- **Privacy and discretion**: your data stays yours.
